1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,140
给  泰国炒面  不加花生
Here we go. pad thai,no peanuts.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,520
里面有花生油吗
But does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,910
我不太清楚
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,820
大家都盯着点霍华德以防他肿起来
Everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,240
既然现在没蜜蜂出没  你可以用我的肾上腺素
Since it's not bee season,you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,270
-有筷子吗  -不需要  这是泰国菜
-are there any chopsticks. -no need. this is thai food.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,600
开始了
Here we go.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,570
泰国在19世纪后半期才有叉子
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,000
{\an8}{\fs20}<font color=#D9D919>东西容器 必属精品{\r}
{\an8}{\fs28}<font color=#FFFFFF> 添加微信公众号：<font color=#FF0000>ABContainer <font color=#FFFFFF>获取更多剧集{\r}

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,990
有趣的是他们不直接把叉子放在嘴里
Interestingly  they don't put the fork in their mouth--

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,330
而是用叉子来把食物放在勺子里然后用勺子放到嘴里
They use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,360
跟他要个餐巾  我量你也不敢
Ask him for a napkin. I dare you.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,520
我去开
I'll get it.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,810
我脸肿了吗  我觉得我脸肿了
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,170
-嘿  莱纳德  -嘿  佩妮
-hey,leonard. -oh,hi,penny.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,290
-我有打扰吗  -没有
-am I interrupting? -no.

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,710
霍华德  你没肿
you're not swelling,howard.

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,650
看看我的手指  他们看起来象维也纳香肠
Look at my fingers. they're like vienna sausages.

19
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,990
-听起来你好象有客人  -他们总在
-sounds like you have company. -they're not going anywhere.

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,000
你下班了  太好了  工作怎么样
So,you're coming home from work. that's great. how was work?

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,920
那是卖芝士蛋糕的
You know,it's a cheesecake factory.

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,870
客人点芝士蛋糕  我给他们端过去
People order cheesecake and I bring it to them.

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,970
这和碳水化合物传送系统有点象
So you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system.

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,350
是  随便你怎么叫  反正拿的工资最低
Yeah. call it whatever you want,I get minimum wage.

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,020
我想问一下你能不能帮我点忙...
I was wondering if you could help me out with something.

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,030
好的
yes.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,520
好的  明天会有人给我送家具
Great. I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,000
我可能不在  所以...
and I may not be here,so...

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,190
好啊
Hello.

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,300
-什么  -有没有人用优美的俄语跟你说过
-i'm sorry? -haven't you ever been told

31
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,580
你是多么的漂亮吗
How beautiful you are in flawless russian?

32
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,190
没有
No,I haven't.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,370
你会习惯的
Get used to it.

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,090
我可能不会
Yeah. I probably won't.

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,420
-嘿  谢尔顿  -嘿
-hey,sheldon. -hi.

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,660
嘿  拉杰
Hey,raj.

37
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,360
还是不跟我说话
Still not talking to me,huh?

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,650
他不是故意和你过不去  这是他的老毛病了
Don't take it personally,it's his pathology.

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,040
他不能跟女人说话
He can't talk to women.

40
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,360
他不能跟漂亮女人说话
He can't talk to atractive woman,or in your case,

41
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,660
或者就是象你这样有迷人芝士蛋糕味的女神
A cheesecake-scented goddess.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,330
明天会有人来送家具?
So there's gonna be some furniture delivered?

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,550
是的  如果送来的时候我不在
Yeah. If it gets here and I'm not here,could you sign

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,380
你能帮我签收一下然后放到我房间吗
And have them put it in my apartment?

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,610
没问题
No problem.

46
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,680
太好了  这是备用钥匙  谢谢
Great. here's my spare key. thank you.

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,100
佩妮  等等
Penny,wait.

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,850
如果你没什么安排的话
If you don't have any other plans,do you want to join us

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,600
你想一起吃点泰国菜看个超人电影马拉松吗
For thai food and a superman movie marathon?

50
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,820
马拉松?  到底有多少部超人电影啊
A marathon? how many superman movies are there?

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
你是开玩笑的  对不对
You're kidding,right?

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,550
我比较喜欢露易丝·莱恩从飞机上掉下来
I do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,190
超人俯冲下去接住她的那部  那是第几部
And superman swooshes down and catches her. which one was that?

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,690
第一部
One.

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
你知道那个场景完全不符合科学吧
You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

56
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,520
是的  我知道  人不能飞
Yes,I know,men can't fly.

57
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,220
不  不  假设人能飞
No. let's assume that they can.

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,170
露易丝·莱恩从高空往下掉
Lois lane is falling,

59
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,960
以每秒32英尺的初速度做自由落体加速
Accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second.

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,160
超人俯冲下来用两个钢筋一样的手臂想要接住她
Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel.

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,800
此时莱恩小姐在以每小时120公里的速度往下掉
Miss lane,who is now traveling At approximately 120 miles an hour

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,890
碰到钢筋手臂  立马被劈成三半
Hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.

63
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,430
但是如果超人也达到那个速度然后减速
Unless superman matches her speed and decelerates.

64
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,890
还有时间吗  先生  她离地面两尺高
In what space,sir? she's two feet above the ground.

65
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,220
如果他真的爱她的话  他应该让她掉在马路上
Frankly,if he really loved her,he'd let her hit the pavement.

66
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,780
那还比较仁慈
It'd be a more merciful death.

67
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,720
你的全部论证都是建立在
Excuse me,your entire argument is predicated on the assumption

68
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,020
超人的飞行有惊人的冲击力的基础上
That superman's flight is a feat of strength.

69
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,330
听到你自己说的了么
Are you listening to yourself? it is well established

70
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,010
很明显他的飞行有无限的冲击力
That his flight is a feat of strength.

71
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,410
这是他能跃过大厦的能力的延伸
It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings,

72
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,980
也是吸收来自太阳的能力
An ability he derives from exposure to earth's yellow sun.

73
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,810
那他晚上怎么也能飞
And how does he fly at night?

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,270
月亮反射的太阳光
A combination of the moon's solar reflection

75
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,970
结合氪星球皮肤细胞储存的能量
And the energy-storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells.

76
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,210
我去洗澡了
I'm just gonna go wash up.

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,690
我有2600本漫画  我打赌
I have 2,600 comic books in there. I challenge you

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,160
你找不到任何有关氪星球皮肤细胞的线索
To find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells.

79
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,550
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

80
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,870
我们被锁在外面了
We're locked out.

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,260
还有  那个美女走了
Also,the pretty girl left.

82
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,910
《生活大爆炸》
第一季  第02集
The.Big.Bran.Hypothesis

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,650
她的公寓在四楼但是电梯坏了所以你得...
ok.Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken,so...

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,490
你就那么走了?  好的  谢谢
You're just gonna be done? okay. cool. thanks

85
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,620
那我们就自己搬上去
We'll just bring it up ourselves.

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,150
我非常不同意
I hardly think so.

87
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,580
为什么
Why not?

88
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,690
我们没有手推车
Well,we don't have a dolly,

89
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,320
也没有吊装带或者胸大肌
Or lifting belts or any measurable upper-body strength.

90
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,510
我们不需要力气  我们是物理学家
We don't need strength--we're physicists.

91
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,280
我们是阿基米德的传人
We are the intellectual descendants of archimedes.

92
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,660
给我一个支点  我可以撬动地球
Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the earth.

93
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,670
只需要...  我弄不动  我弄不动
It's just a matter of... I don't have this.

94
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,230
阿基米德肯定非常自豪
Archimedes would be so proud.

95
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,560
你有什么主意吗
Do you have any ideas?

96
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,890
是的  但都需要绿灯侠和魔戒
Yes,but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.

97
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,280
-慢点  -慢点
Easy... easy.

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,280
好的
Ok.

99
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,300
现在有了个斜面
Now we've got an inclined plane. the force required to lift

100
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,530
拉力由于楼梯的正弦角而减少了...
Is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs,

101
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,240
角度大约是30度  那就减少了差不多一半
Call it 30 degrees,so,about half.

102
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,010
正好一半
Exactly half.

103
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
正好一半
Exactly half.

104
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950
推吧
Let's push.

105
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,900
看  动了  很简单
See,it's moving,this is easy.

106
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,780
数学里都证明了
It's all in the math.

107
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,160
-转角的公式是什么  -什么
-what's your formula for the corner? -what?

108
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,740
好的  没问题
Okay,no problem.

109
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
上来  帮我拉上来然后拐弯
Just come up here,help me pull and turn.

110
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,180
重力  太没良心了
Ah,gravity,thou art a heartless bitch.

111
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,100
你知道我们花这么大的力气
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds

112
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,200
一点也不会增加你和这个女人性交的几率
Of you having sexual congress with this woman.

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,970
男人为女人做事不是为了做爱
Men do things for women without expecting sex.

114
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,210
那是刚做完爱的男人
Those would be men who just had sex.

115
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,890
我这么做是为了做个好邻居
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

116
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,320
再说也不会减少几率
In any case,there's no way it could lower the odds.

117
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,370
快到了
Almost there.

118
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
快到了
Almost there.

119
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,930
-快到了  -没  还没有
-almost there. -no,we're not.

120
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,820
没  还没有  没  还没有
-i'm sorry. -no,we're not!

121
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,080
小心你的手指
Watch your fingers.

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,820
天  我的手指
Oh,god,my fingers!

123
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,930
-你还好吗  -不好  她...
-you okay? -no,her...

124
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,800
见鬼了  看看这个地方
Great caesar's ghost,look at this place.

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,620
佩妮这也就是有一点点乱
So penny's a little messy.

126
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,340
一点点乱?
A little messy?

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,570
曼德尔布罗特集合才叫一点点乱
The mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy.

128
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,800
这完全是一塌糊涂
This is chaos.

129
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,530
问一下
Excuse me.

130
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,670
跟我解释下托盘餐具放在沙发上
Explain to me an organizational system

131
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,890
这算哪门子组织系统
Where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,680
我刚才有提到过这是沙发
I'm just inferring this is a couch

133
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,710
因为证据表明咖啡桌上
Because the evidence suggests the coffee table

134
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,250
正在举办小型二手货贩卖
Is having a tiny garage sale.

135
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,980
你有没有想过并不是世界上所有的人
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has

136
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,340
都有那种强迫症
The compulsive need to sort,organize and label

137
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
要把身边的东西都按顺序排好贴上标签?
The entire world around them?

138
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,880
没有
No.

139
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,430
他们不是那样的
Well,they don't.

140
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,390
你可能不太相信
Hard as it may be for you to believe,

141
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,920
大多数人不会把早餐麦片按纤维含量的顺序排列
Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber Content.

142
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,050
但是我相信我们都觉察到那有时候很管用
Excuse me,but I think we've both found that helpful at times.

143
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,550
-快点  该走了  -等等
-come on,we should go. -hang on.

144
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,570
-你在干吗  -我在整理
-what are you doing? -i'm straightening up.

145
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,860
谢尔顿  这不是你的家
This is not your home.

146
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,540
这谁的家都不是  这是一团乱熵(熵越大  系统越无序)
This is not anyone's home. this is a swirling vortex of entropy.

147
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,890
当那个异性装扮癖者住在这的时候你可没关心他怎么布置的这个地方
When the transvestite lived here,you didn't care how he kept the place.

148
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,570
那是因为太完美无暇了
Because it was immaculate.

149
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,830
你打开那个男人的衣柜
I mean,you opened that man's closet,

150
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,610
从左到右依次是晚礼服
It was left to right evening gowns,

151
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,940
燕尾服然后是他的警察制服
Cocktail dresses,then his police uniforms.

152
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,030
你开他的衣柜干吗
What were you doing in his closet?

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,250
我帮他拉电缆装网络摄象头
I helped him run some cable for a web cam.

154
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,250
-好啊  两位  -好啊  佩妮
Hey guys. Hey penny

155
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,610
家具到了  我们刚运上来  刚刚
This just arrived,we just brought this up... just now.

156
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,990
太好了  运上来费劲吗
Great. was it hard getting it up the stairs?

157
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,460
-不费劲  -不费劲?
-no. -"no"?

158
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,700
一点都不费劲
No.

159
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,170
一点都不
No.

160
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,850
那我们不打扰你了
Well,we'll get out of your hair.

161
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,430
好的  再次感谢
Okay,great. thank you again.

162
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,700
佩妮
penny

163
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,200
我想让你知道你不需要这样生活
I just want you to know that you don't have to live like this.

164
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,510
我愿意为你效劳
I'm here for you.

165
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,260
他在说什么
What's he talking about?

166
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,260
-是个笑话  -我没听懂
-it's a joke. -i don't get it.

167
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,880
对  是他说的不好
Yeah,he didn't tell it right.

168
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,880
谢尔顿
sheldon

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
谢尔顿
sheldon

170
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,880
有人吗
hello

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,710
谢尔顿
sheldon

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,710
佩妮在睡觉
Penny's sleeping.

173
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,320
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

174
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,310
你不能在半夜
You can't just break into a woman's apartment

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,060
闯进一个女人的公寓  打扫
In the middle of the night and clean.

176
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,730
我别无选择  我睡不着
I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing

177
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,870
想到在我卧室外面是我们的客厅
That just outside my bedroom was our living room,

178
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,110
在我们客厅外面是走廊
And just outside our living room was that hallway,

179
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,080
和走廊这边就是...这个样子
And immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.

180
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,160
你有没有意识到如果佩妮醒过来
Do you realize that if penny wakes up,

181
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,130
我们根本无法合理的解释为什么在这
There is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.

182
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,870
我刚给了个你合理的解释
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

183
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
没  没  你只是给了个解释
No,no,you gave me an explanation.

184
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,440
它的合理性要由你的陪审团来决定
Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,750
搞笑  我哪来的陪审团
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

186
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,170
我们得赶快离开这
We have to get out of here.

187
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,980
你应该用低音区说话
You might want to speak in a lower register.

188
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,460
什么
What?

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,930
进化使得女人在睡觉的时候
Evolution has made women sensitive

190
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,740
对高音区的噪音非常敏感
To high-pitched noises while they sleep

191
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,920
所以她们才能在婴儿哭的时候醒来
So that they'll be roused by a crying baby.

192
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,610
如果你不想吵醒她
If you want to avoid waking her,

193
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,500
就用低音区说话
Speak in a lower register.

194
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,740
那太荒谬了
That's ridiculous!

195
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,010
不对
No.

196
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,410
那太荒谬了
"that's ridiculous."

197
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,820
好吧
Fine.

198
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,610
我接受你的理论  我们快走吧
I accept your premise. now,please,let's go.

199
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,950
不弄好我是不会走的
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

200
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,310
你有靠在那的时间不如打扫
If you have time to lean,you have time to clean.

201
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,860
随便吧
Oh,what the hell.

202
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,940
早上好
Morning.

203
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,680
早上好
Morning.

204
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
我必须要说我睡的非常香甜
I have to say I slept splendidly.

205
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,260
虽然时间不长但是睡眠质量很好
Granted,not long,but just deeply and well.

206
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,270
我一点也不感到奇怪
I'm not surprised.

207
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,100
失眠的灵丹妙药就是
A well-known folk cure for insomnia

208
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,930
闯到邻居家里打扫
Is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean.

209
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,060
讽刺?
Sarcasm?

210
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,870
你觉得是吗
You think?

211
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,210
就算是吧  我的方法可能有点唐突
Granted,my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox,

212
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,160
但是我认为这能很好的提高佩妮的生活质量
But I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement

213
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,680
你说的对
-to penny's quality of life -you've convinced me.

214
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,480
也许今晚我们应该偷溜进去把她的地毯洗了
Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

215
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,820
-你不认为那太过分了吗  -是
-you don't think that crosses a line? -yes.

216
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,380
天啊
For god's sake,

217
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,310
哪次我开口说话都得举个讽刺的牌子吗
Do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?

218
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,450
你有讽刺的牌子?
You have a sarcasm sign?

219
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,400
不  我没有讽刺的牌子
No,I do not have a sarcasm sign.

220
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,640
你想来点麦片吗  我觉得我今天情绪高涨
Do you want some cereal? I feel so good today,

221
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,000
我今天要选架子尾的低纤维
I'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

222
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,570
好啊  honey puffs
Hello,honey puffs.

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,850
妈的
Son of a bitch!

224
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,880
佩妮起来了
Penny's up.

225
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,280
你们这些怪物混蛋
You sick geeky bastards!

226
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,450
她怎么知道是我们干的?
How did she know it was us?

227
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,150
我可能不小心留下了
I may have left a suggested organizational schematic

228
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,560
如何整理卧室衣柜的建议图解
For her bedroom closet.

229
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,060
莱纳德
leonard

230
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,540
天那  这下要糟了
God,this is gonna be bad.

231
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,010
再见  honey puffs  好啊  big bran
Good-bye,honey puffs. hello,big bran.

232
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,780
昨晚在我睡觉的时候你们溜进我的公寓了?
You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!

233
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,180
是的  只是为了打扫
Yes,but only to clean.

234
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,980
准确的说是整理  你那里其实不太脏
Really more to organize. you're not actually dirty,per se.

235
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,480
把钥匙还给我
Give me back my key.

236
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,170
我非常抱歉
I'm very,very sorry.

237
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,260
你知道这有多么的恐怖吗
Do you understand how creepy this is?

238
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,620
是的  我们昨晚讨论了好久
Oh,yes,we discussed it at length last night.

239
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,240
在我的房间  在我睡觉的时候
In my apartment,while I was sleeping?!

240
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,520
还有打呼  可能是有点鼻窦感染
And snoring. and that's probably just a sinus infection.

241
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,190
但也有可能是睡眠呼吸暂停综合症
But it could be sleep apnea.

242
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,300
你可能需要看一下耳鼻喉科医师
You might want to see an otolaryngologist.

243
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,240
喉科医生
A throat doctor.

244
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,880
哪种医生能把鞋从屁股上取下来
And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?

245
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,350
那要取决于深度
Depending on the depth,

246
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,170
要么是...直肠科医师
That's either a... proctologist

247
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,830
要么是外科医生
Or a general surgeon.

248
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,230
讽刺
sacasm

249
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,230
天啊
god

250
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,600
佩妮  我认为你现在的感觉非常正常
penny I think what you're feeling

251
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,700
也许等你没这么感觉...
Is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later

252
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,930
因为没别的词了  被侵犯
When you're feeling a little less... for lack of a better word--violated,

253
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,690
我们可以好好谈一下
Maybe we can talk about this some more.

254
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,130
-离我远点  -好的  那是另一个办法
-stay away from me. -sure,that's another way to go.

255
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,550
佩妮  佩妮  等等
Penny,penny! hold on

256
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,230
先声明
Just to clarify,

257
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,850
因为你走后我们肯定会讨论
Because there will be a discussion when you leave,

258
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,200
你是只对我们在你睡觉的时候
Is your objection solely to our presence

259
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,130
进入你的房间反感呢
In the apartment while you were sleeping,

260
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,630
还是你对我们强加的整理体系也感到反感?
Or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm.

261
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,150
那可真有点呆若木鸡啊
Well,that was a little non-responsive.

262
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,810
你现在马上把自己送过去道歉
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize.

263
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,910
有什么好笑的
What's funny?

264
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,940
那不是讽刺吗
That wasn't sarcasm?

265
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,940
不是
No

266
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,310
天啊  你今天真是一塌糊涂
Boy,you are all over the place this morning.

267
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,090
我有一个硕士两个博士  我不应该做这个
I have a master's and two ph.d.s,I should not have to do this.

268
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,440
干吗
What?!

269
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,330
我为昨晚的事感到非常抱歉
I am truly sorry for what happened last night.

270
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,020
责任全在我
I take full responsibility.

271
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,000
我希望这不会影响你对莱纳德的看法
And I hope that it won't color your opinion of leonard,

272
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,710
他不仅是个非常好的人而且我还听说
Who is not only a wonderful guy,but also,I hear,

273
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,650
是个非常完美的情人
A gentle and thorough lover.

274
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,740
我能做的都做了
I did what I could.

275
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,540
嘿  拉杰
Hey,raj.

276
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,010
嘿
Hey,listen.

277
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,890
我不知道你听说昨晚莱纳德和谢尔顿干的事了没有
I don't know if you heard about what happened last night.

278
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,470
但是我感到非常气愤
But I'm really upset about it.

279
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,800
他们不请自入的进了我的房间
I mean,they just... they let themselves into my place

280
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,180
然后他们把房子打扫了一遍  你相信吗
And then they cleaned it. can you even believe that?

281
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,520
太诡异了
How weird is that?

282
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,610
她离我好近
She's standing very close to me.

283
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,690
她闻起来真香
Oh,my,she does smell good.

284
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,890
是什么  香草味的吗
What is that,vanilla?

285
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,390
在我们那
You know,where I come from,

286
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,520
如果有人晚上闯入你的家  你可以开枪  知道吗
If someone comes into your house at night,you shoot. okay?

287
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,010
不仅仅是打伤
And you don't shoot to wound.

288
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,020
我妹妹对她老公开了次枪
I mean,all right,my sister shot her husband,

289
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,900
但是那是次意外  他们都喝醉了
But it was an accident,they were drunk.

290
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,320
我在说什么来着
Wait,what was I saying?

291
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,650
她可真罗嗦啊
She's so chatty.

292
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,520
也许我父母是对的  我应该找个印度女孩
maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an indian girl.

293
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,350
我们有相同的文化背景
We'd have the same cultural background

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,530
我老婆就可以给我孩子唱
And my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang

295
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,900
我妈妈经常给我唱的那首摇篮曲
To me.

296
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,990
虽然他们是好意  但是我...
It's obvious that they meant well,but...

297
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,890
我现在过的很不好  我说过我和我男朋友分手了
I'm having a really rough time. like i said I broke up with my boyfriend

298
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,570
我有点乱了阵脚
And...

299
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,760
虽然我认识的大部分男人都是混蛋
i mean Just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks,

300
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,740
并不意味着莱纳德和谢尔顿也是
Doesn't mean I should just assume leonard and sheldon are.

301
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,000
是吧
Right?

302
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,960
她问了我个问题  我或许应该点头
She asked me a question. I should probably nod.

303
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,940
我也是这么想的
That's exactly what I thought.

304
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,340
谢谢你的倾听  你太可爱了
Thank you for listening. you're a doll.

305
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,160
转动胯部
Turn your pelvis.

306
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,400
拿张餐巾吧  兄弟  你刚被伺候了
Grab a napkin,homie. you just got served.

307
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,090
算了  你赢了
It's fine.you win.

308
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,040
他怎么了
What's his problem?

309
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,730
他的假想女朋友和他分手了
His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.

310
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,730
经历过
Been there.

311
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,590
抱歉我现在才来
Hello. Sorry I'm late,

312
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,010
但是我在走廊里和佩妮聊天来着
But I was in the hallway,chatting up penny.

313
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,010
真的假的  你拉杰·库萨帕里和佩妮说话了?
Really? you,rajesh koothrappali,spoke to penny?

314
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,050
实际上我说的比哑巴还少
Actually,I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.

315
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,870
她说什么了  她还生我的气吗
What did she say? is she still mad at me?

316
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,550
刚开始她是很生气
Well,she was upset at first,

317
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,250
可能是因为她姐姐用枪射了某个人
But probably because her sister shot somebody.

318
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,370
然后好象说了点关于你的事
But then there was something about you,

319
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,910
然后她抱了下我
And then she hugged me.

320
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,860
她抱你了?  她怎么抱你的?
She hugged you? how'd she hug you?

321
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,300
那个香水是她身上的吗
Is that her perfume I smell?

322
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,150
非常醉人  是不是
Intoxicating,isn't it?

323
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,030
好啊
Hi.

324
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,420
你在干吗
What's going on?

325
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,070
是这样的
Here's the thing.

326
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,180
佩妮  就象奥本海默
"penny,just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions

327
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,850
后悔发明了原子弹一样
"to the first atomic bomb,

328
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,320
我也后悔了我的加入
"so too I regret my participation in what was,

329
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,540
至少是次错误的判断
"at the very least,an error in judgment.

330
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,230
一个伟大的实验的标志就是
"the hallmark of the great human experiment

331
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,390
敢于承认自己犯下的错误
"is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes.

332
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,890
有些错误  象居里夫人发现了镭
"some mistakes,such as madam curie's discovery of radium,

333
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,910
后来被证明有很大的科学研究价值
"turned out to have great scientific potential,

334
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,580
尽管她后来死于
"even though she would later die a slow,

335
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,350
漫长而痛苦的放射线危害
Painful death "from radiation poisoning.

336
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,350
还有另一个例子 埃博拉研究...
Another example,from the field of ebola research..."

337
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,380
莱纳德  我们之间没事了
Leonard,we're okay.

338
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,040
-六个两寸的木钉  -有
-six two inch dowels. -check.

339
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,110
-一盒十字螺丝钉  -有
-one package phillips head screws. -check.

340
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,230
各位  我是在农场长大的
You guys,seriously,I grew up on a farm,okay?

341
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,490
我12岁的时候自己装起来了个拖拉机发动机
I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was,like,12.

342
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,010
我想我能装个廉价的瑞典电视柜
I think I can put together a cheap,swedish media center.

343
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,090
还是我们来  这是我们唯一能做的  鉴于...
No,please. we insist. it's the least we can do,considering.

344
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,580
鉴于什么
Considering what?

345
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,590
这个地方看起来有多么漂亮?
How great this place looks?

346
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,040
-我就担心这个  -怎么了
-oh,boy. I was afraid of this. -what?

347
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,030
这些说明书用都是些图解
These instructions are a pictographic representation

348
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,070
用最没有想象力的方式组合的这些零件
Of the least imaginative way to assemble these components.

349
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,540
这就是为什么瑞典没有太空项目
This,right here is why sweden has no space program.

350
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,920
在店里看起来挺漂亮的
Well,it looked pretty good in the store.

351
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,030
这个设计非常不合理  假设她有个平板电视
It is an inefficient design. for example,she has a flat screen tv,

352
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,160
那就意味着这后面的空间都浪费了
Which means all the space behind it is wasted.

353
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,910
-我们可以把音响放这  -那怎么遥控
-we could put her stereo back there. -and control it how?

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
装个红外线转接器
Run an infrared repeater.

355
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,820
光电管装这  接受器装这  小菜一碟
Photo cell here,emitter here,easy-peasy.

356
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,600
想法不错  怎么冷却
Good point.How are you gonna cool it?

357
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,870
-嘿  我知道怎么弄了  -等等  佩妮
-hey,guys,I got this. -hang on,penny.

358
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,470
用风扇怎么样  这里一个  这里一个
How about fans? here and here.

359
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,510
还是不太合理而且可能有噪音
Also inefficient,and might be loud.

360
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,070
液体冷却剂怎么样  在这弄个水泵
How about liquid coolant? maybe a little aquarium pump here,

361
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,740
装四分之一英寸的聚氯乙烯
Run some quarter-inch pvc...

362
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,760
这个东西其实挺简单的
Guys,this is actually really simple.

363
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,210
等会  亲爱的  男人在干活
Hold on,honey. men at work.

364
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,020
聚氯乙烯循环到这
The pvc comes down here.

365
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,430
用点波纹薄钢板在这做散热器
Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

366
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,520
是吗  那怎么装水盘  水闸
Yeah? show me where we put a drip tray,a sluice,

367
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,760
还有蓄水池
And an overflow reservoir.

368
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,910
如果用到水  那就要把这玩意得接地吧
If water's involved,we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing.

369
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,770
这里好热哦  我还是把衣服脱光了吧
It's hot in here. I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

370
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,490
我想出来了
Oh,I've got it.

371
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,350
如果我们把
What about if we replace

372
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,160
嵌板A  B  F和横木H都换成航空铝
Panels a,b and f and crossbar h with aircraft-grade aluminum?

373
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,250
对了  那整个就都是散热片
Right. then the entire thing is one heat sink.

374
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,270
完美  你和谢尔顿去废物堆积场
You and sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up

375
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,770
找个6平方的铝合板
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?

376
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,780
我和拉杰搞定氧乙炔喷焊器
Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.

377
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,510
-一小时后在这见?  -好的
-meet back here in an hour? -done.

378
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,630
好吧  这个地方确实看起来挺棒的
Okay,this place does look pretty good.
