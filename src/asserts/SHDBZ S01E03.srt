Us guys?

246
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,710
{\fs16\an2\b0}对 谢尔顿 霍华德 拉杰 他们都一起吧?
Yeah,you know,sheldon,howard,raj. Who all's coming?

247
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}他们...可能都会去吧
They... might all be there.

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}或者他们中的有些人可能去
Or a subset of them might be there.

249
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,480
{\fs16\an2\b0}从代数角度看 太多未知数了
Algebraically speaking,there are too many unknowns.

250
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}比如 谢尔顿中午吃了Quizno三明治
For example,sheldon had quiznos for lunch.

251
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,180
{\fs16\an2\b0}有时他觉得吃那个饱 有时候不觉得
Sometimes he finds that filling,other times he doesn'T.

252
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}这不是店家的错 他们的菜单很丰盛
It's no fault of quiznos- - they have a varied menu.

253
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,320
{\fs16\an2\b0}好吧 无所谓啦 听起来挺有意思的
Okay,whatever. It sounds like fun.

254
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}很好 我们约时间了吗?
Great. Did we say a time?

255
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,100
{\fs16\an2\b0}6点半
6:30.

256
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,900
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 你确定那时有空? - 对
- And that's still good for you? - It's fine.

257
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,610
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 不是刻在石板上非得那时去哦 - 6点半正好
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone. - No,6:30's great.

258
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,830
{\fs16\an2\b0}我去拿凿子
I'll get my chisel.

259
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}为什么?
Why?

260
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,800
{\fs16\an2\b0}去刻在石...6点半见
To... carve the... I'll see you at 6:30.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,790
{\fs16\an2\b0}我看起来如何?
How do I look?

262
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,220
{\fs16\an2\b0}你能说具体一点吗?
Could you be more specific?

263
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,010
{\fs16\an2\b0}能看出来我在冒汗吗?
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

264
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,100
{\fs16\an2\b0}不能
No.

265
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,740
{\fs16\an2\b0}你腋下深色的新月状图案 将其隐藏的很好
The dark crescent shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.

266
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,780
{\fs16\an2\b0}你几点约会?
What time is your date?

267
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,760
{\fs16\an2\b0}6点半
6:30.

268
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}太好了 那你还有2小时15分
Perfect. That gives you two hours and 15 minutes for

269
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,350
{\fs16\an2\b0}让那片稠密的人造纤维分子云消散
that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate.

270
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}汗很多吗?
Is it too much?

271
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,780
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果你是橄榄球队员就不算多
Not if you're a rugby team.

272
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,650
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果以后提到今晚的事 你没来参加的原因是
By the way,if it should ever come up,you didn't join us

273
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}你在Quiznos吃鸡肉三明治吃撑了
because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quiznos.

274
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,110
{\fs16\an2\b0}我为什么要去参加?
Why would I join you?

275
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,030
{\fs16\an2\b0}不为什么
No reason.

276
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,840
{\fs16\an2\b0}你知道吗 也许这样做不好
Oh,you know what,maybe this isn't such a good idea.

277
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}不 酒精加上她一时糊涂
Oh,no,well,now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment

278
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,950
{\fs16\an2\b0}总有可能让今晚成为浪漫之夜
on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.

279
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,570
{\fs16\an2\b0}你说的对 酒 糊涂 今晚有可能会顺利的
You're right. Alcohol,poor judgment- - it could go well.

280
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,920
{\fs16\an2\b0}当然还有另一种可能性
Of course there is the other possibility,

281
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,650
{\fs16\an2\b0}之后的6个月都会很难捱
that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months

282
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,400
{\fs16\an2\b0}俩人在走廊里尴尬的擦身而过
of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall,

283
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,060
{\fs16\an2\b0}直到其中一人崩溃并搬到别的州去
until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.

284
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,480
{\fs16\an2\b0}你说到"可能会顺利"就可以闭嘴了
You could've stopped at "it could go well.

285
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,350
{\fs16\an2\b0}"如果我能 我会的"
" If I could've,I would've.

286
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,430
{\fs16\an2\b0}我是绝种好男人
I mean,I'm a perfectly nice guy.

287
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,020
{\fs16\an2\b0}没理由我们不能 在餐厅吃好顿晚餐
There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant,and have a lovely dinner,

288
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,530
{\fs16\an2\b0}饭后散散步 聊些共同话题
maybe take a walk afterwards,talk about things we have in common.

289
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,160
{\fs16\an2\b0}"你喜欢陶艺? 我超爱陶艺的!"
You love pottery? I love pottery!

290
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}然后暂停一下 我们都知道接下来要发生什么
There's a pause,we both know what's happening.

291
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,980
{\fs16\an2\b0}我倾身向前 我俩接吻
I lean in,we kiss.

292
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,920
{\fs16\an2\b0}开始时还有点犹豫 然后她开始回吻我
It's a little tentative at first,but then I realize she's kissing me back.

293
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,200
{\fs16\an2\b0}她在咬我的下唇! 她想要我!
She's biting my lower lip! She wants me!

294
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,260
{\fs16\an2\b0}这事能成!我们会做爱!
This thing is going the distance! We're going to have sex!

295
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,430
{\fs16\an2\b0}天 上帝啊!
Oh,god,oh,my god!

296
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,690
{\fs16\an2\b0}现在开始做爱了?
Is the sex starting now?

297
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,000
{\fs16\an2\b0}我恐慌症发作了
I'm having a panic attack.

298
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,790
{\fs16\an2\b0}好吧 冷静点
Oh,okay. Uh,well then... calm down.

299
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果我能冷静 就不会恐慌了!
If I could calm down,I wobe having a panic att...

300
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,270
{\fs16\an2\b0}不然这怎么叫做恐慌症发作!
that's why they call it a panic attack.

301
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,660
{\fs16\an2\b0}好好 你坐下
All right,all right. Uh,s- s- sit down.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}坐下 闭上眼
Yeah,sit down. Now close your eyes.

303
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 为什么? - 照做吧!
- Why? - Just do it.

304
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,020
{\fs16\an2\b0}好
Okay.

305
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}α波是脑电图中最著名的一种波在正常成年人闭眼放松时产生

306
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}试着增加你α波的活性
Now try to increase your alpha wave activity.

307
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,190
{\fs16\an2\b0}什么? !
What? !

308
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,360
{\fs16\an2\b0}这是机能反馈疗法
It's a biofeedback technique.

309
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,200
{\fs16\an2\b0}通过控制脑电波来放松
It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation.

310
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,000
{\fs16\an2\b0}我在美国神经科学月刊上 看到一篇关于它的论文
I read a paper about it in journal of american neuroscience.

311
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}它的理论来源不完备 但是我认为基本原理正确
It was a little sparsely sourced,but I think the basic science is valid.

312
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,510
{\fs16\an2\b0}我可能把它放在这了
I probably have it here somewher E.

313
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}我没法赴这个约会
Who am I kidding? I can't go through with this.

314
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}你给她打电话取消吧
You need to call her and cancel.

315
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,730
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 我? - 对
- Me? - Yes.

316
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,990
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 我要跟她说什么? - 我不知道
- What should I tell her? - I don't know.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,730
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 跟她说我病了 - 好
- Tell her I'm sick. - Okay.

318
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,400
{\fs16\an2\b0}别说那种会让她想来照顾我的病
Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me,

319
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,990
{\fs16\an2\b0}也不要严重得让她 以后不愿跟我约会的病
but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果我以后还想尝试的话
if I want to try this again.

321
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,220
{\fs16\an2\b0}了解
Got it.

322
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,000
{\fs16\an2\b0}那不能说花柳病啦?
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?

323
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,980
{\fs16\an2\b0}就跟她说你做了例行肠镜检查 还没恢复吧
I'll just tell her that you had a routine conoloscopy and haven't quite bounced back.

324
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}给我电话
Give me the phone.

325
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,530
{\fs16\an2\b0}你不是想取消约会吗?
I thought you wanted to cancel.

326
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,220
{\fs16\an2\b0}不行 如果我不出现 她还是会认为你会去的
I can't,because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.

327
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}为什么她认为我会去?
Why would she be expecting me?

328
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}别问了 我要再去洗个澡
Stop asking me all these questions. I need to take another shower.

329
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,950
{\fs16\an2\b0}其他的人直接来这找我们?
So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?

330
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,010
{\fs16\an2\b0}对...不对
Oh,yeah... no.

331
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,250
{\fs16\an2\b0}拉杰跟霍华德要工作 谢尔顿...
It turns out that raj and howard had to work,and sheldon...

332
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,200
{\fs16\an2\b0}做了肠镜 还没恢复过来
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

333
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}我叔叔也做了肠镜
Oh,my uncle just had a colonoscopy.

334
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,570
{\fs16\an2\b0}这就是我们俩的共同之处了
You're kidding. Then that's something we have in common.

335
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,340
{\fs16\an2\b0}怎么说?
How?

336
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,370
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们都认识...
We both have people in our lives who...

337
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,820
{\fs16\an2\b0}想将肠道息肉扼杀于摇篮当中的人
want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

338
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,520
{\fs16\an2\b0}物理界有啥新闻不?
so what's new in the world of physics?

339
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,900
{\fs16\an2\b0}没有
Nothing.

340
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,210
{\fs16\an2\b0}真的? 一点都没有?
Really? Nothing?

341
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,890
{\fs16\an2\b0}除了弦理论 自1930年后就没什么发现了
Well,with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s.

342
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}而弦理论也尚未证明
And you can't prove string theory.

343
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,580
{\fs16\an2\b0}最多就能说
At best you can say,"hey,look,

344
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,350
{\fs16\an2\b0}"嘿 我的理论内部逻辑很连贯"
my idea has an internal logical consistency.

345
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,780
{\fs16\an2\b0}啊
" Ah.

346
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,950
{\fs16\an2\b0}我相信情况会好转的
Well,I'm sure things will pick up.

347
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,430
{\fs16\an2\b0}芝士蛋糕工厂那边有什么新消息?
What's new at the cheesecake factory?

348
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,970
{\fs16\an2\b0}没有什么
Oh,uh,not much.

349
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,580
{\fs16\an2\b0}有个巧克力柠檬派卖得很好
We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.

350
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,560
{\fs16\an2\b0}很好
Good. Good.

351
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,440
{\fs16\an2\b0}那你那个...
What about your,uh...

352
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,260
{\fs16\an2\b0}过道上的朋友怎样?
hallway friend?

353
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,800
{\fs16\an2\b0}道格? 我不知道
Doug? Oh,yeah,I don't know.

354
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,920
{\fs16\an2\b0}他人挺好也很风趣 但是...
I mean,you know,he's nice and funny,but...

355
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}准备开始点饮品了吗?
can I get you started with some drinks?

356
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}不!
No!

357
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,420
{\fs16\an2\b0}- 你刚刚说到? 但是... - 我想喝点东西
- You were saying? But... - I'd like a drink.

358
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,320
{\fs16\an2\b0}先说完关于道格的"但是" 我会把她叫回来
Just say the "but" thing about doug and then I'll get her back.

359
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,550
{\fs16\an2\b0}我不知道 是我的问题
Okay,well,I don't know,it's just me.

360
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,990
{\fs16\an2\b0}我还没从跟科特的分手中完全恢复
I'm still getting over this breakup with kurt

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}跟道格在一起是为了复健性爱
and this thing with doug would stju be rebound sex.

362
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,580
{\fs16\an2\b0}噢 提起复健性爱啊...
Oh,don't get me started on rebound sex.

363
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,440
{\fs16\an2\b0}我总是这样
It's just... it's my pattern.

364
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,840
{\fs16\an2\b0}分手后找个帅哥
I break up,then I find some cute guy,

365
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,770
{\fs16\an2\b0}然后就是36小时毫无意义的...
